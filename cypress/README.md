# Cypress Tests for Healthshare Plan Finder

This directory contains end-to-end tests for the Healthshare Plan Finder application using Cypress.

## Test Structure

The tests are organized into the following categories:

- **Basic Tests** (`basic.cy.js`): Basic application functionality, page loading, and primary user flows
- **UI Components** (`ui-components.cy.js`): Tests for UI elements and interactive components
- **Questionnaire Flow** (`questionnaire-flow.cy.js`): Tests specific to the questionnaire experience
- **Compliance Requirements** (`compliance.cy.js`): Tests to ensure legal compliance and proper disclaimers
- **Plan Results** (`plan-results.cy.js.skip`): Tests for plan recommendation functionality (manually verified)
- **Plan Comparison** (`plan-comparison.cy.js.skip`): Tests for comparing multiple plans side-by-side (manually verified)
- **Performance** (`performance.cy.js`): Basic performance tests for page load times and optimizations

> **Note**: Plan Results and Plan Comparison tests are marked with `.skip` extension and require manual verification. These tests involve complex form filling that is difficult to automate reliably. You can rename the files to remove the `.skip` extension if you want to run them.

## Running Tests

To run the tests:

1. Ensure the application is running on port 3003:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

2. In a separate terminal window, run Cypress:
   ```
   npx cypress open --config baseUrl=http://localhost:3003
   ```

3. Select "E2E Testing" when the Cypress window opens
4. Choose a browser (Chrome recommended)
5. Select the test file you want to run

## Custom Commands

The following custom commands are available to help with testing:

- `cy.login(email, password)`: Log in with the specified credentials
- `cy.startQuestionnaire()`: Navigate to the questionnaire from the homepage
- `cy.fillBasicQuestionnaireInfo(age, zipCode, householdSize)`: Fill out basic questionnaire fields
- `cy.hasFormErrors()`: Check if the form has validation errors
- `cy.clickButton(textPattern)`: Find and click a button matching the given text pattern
- `cy.selectPlan(planNamePattern)`: Select a plan by matching its name

## Test Design Principles

1. **Resilience**: Tests are designed to be resilient to minor UI changes by using:
   - Flexible selectors
   - Text pattern matching
   - Fallback strategies

2. **Independence**: Each test should be independent and not rely on the state from previous tests

3. **Readability**: Tests should be easy to understand and maintain

4. **Compliance Focus**: Compliance tests specifically check for:
   - Proper healthcare sharing ministry disclaimers
   - Comprehensive legal disclosures
   - Accessible legal documentation

## Common Test Failures & Solutions

### Multiple Elements Issue
If tests fail with "`cy.X() can only be called on a single element. Your subject contained N elements`":
- Use `.first()` or `.eq(index)` to select a specific element
- Add more specific selectors to target the exact element
- Use `.contains()` to find an element with specific text

### Page Navigation Timing Issues
If tests fail with "`failed because the page updated while this command was executing`":
- Break up chains using `.as()` aliases
- Add appropriate wait commands or assertions
- Visit the page again before continuing with complex interactions
- Use `{force: true}` for click operations when needed

### Element Not Found
If tests fail with "`Timed out retrying: Expected to find element X but never found it`":
- Check if selectors match the actual HTML structure
- Use more flexible selectors (e.g., `[data-testid*="partial"]`)
- Look for text content rather than specific element types
- Add `cy.wait()` if the element appears after an async operation

### Compliance Test Failures
If disclaimer tests fail:
- Check that `<Disclaimers>` component is used in the footer with `variant="footer"`
- Ensure all legal pages exist and are accessible
- Make sure disclaimers contain required phrases about healthcare sharing ministries
- Review the actual content against required compliance phrases

## Troubleshooting

- If tests fail because elements are not found, check if the selectors need to be updated
- For timing issues, use `cy.wait()` sparingly or add appropriate assertions to wait for elements
- If a test is flaky, consider making the selectors more specific or adding more wait conditions
- For numeric form fields, ensure test inputs match expected formats:
  - Use `78620` or another valid ZIP code for location fields
  - Use reasonable numeric values for age (e.g., `35`), income (e.g., `50000`), etc.
  - Avoid using text like "test" for numeric fields
- If questionnaire tests aren't progressing to results, you may need to:
  - Check form validation requirements
  - Update ZIP code to a valid one where plans are available
  - Increase the number of iteration steps to complete longer questionnaires
  - Add extra assertions to confirm page transitions

## Adding New Tests

When adding new tests:

1. Follow the existing patterns for test organization
2. Use custom commands when possible to keep tests concise
3. Add detailed comments explaining test logic
4. Consider implementing new custom commands for repeated test operations
