# Healthshare Site Pre-Launch Guide

## Pre-Launch Process Overview

This guide outlines the step-by-step process for verifying and deploying the Healthshare Plan Finder application to production.

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

Ensure all required dependencies are installed:

```bash
npm install
```

## Step 2: Run Automated Verification Suite

Run the complete pre-launch verification process:

```bash
npm run pre-launch
```

This will:
- Check cross-browser compatibility
- Verify mobile responsiveness
- Test all forms and user flows
- Validate tracking and analytics
- Run security scans
- Test the production build
- Run end-to-end tests
- Verify backup systems

A comprehensive report will be generated in the `reports/pre-launch-[timestamp]/` directory.

## Step 3: Address Any Failed Checks

If any automated checks fail:

1. Review the master report to identify failures
2. Fix the identified issues
3. Run the relevant individual tests to verify fixes:
   ```bash
   # Example: Re-run form verification after fixing a form issue
   npm run verify:forms
   ```
4. Run the complete verification suite again after all fixes

## Step 4: Complete Manual Verification

Use the detailed checklist in `PRE_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md` to manually verify:

- Content accuracy and completeness
- Link functionality
- Visual appearance across devices
- Performance optimization
- Domain and SSL configuration
- Email functionality
- Analytics setup
- Error handling
- SEO implementation
- Accessibility compliance
- Backup procedures
- Monitoring systems

## Step 5: Final Approval

## Step 6: Production Deployment

```bash
# Ensure you're on the main branch
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes
git pull

# Deploy to production environment
npm run production-build
```

## Step 7: Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment:

1. Run smoke tests on production
2. Verify key functionality works
3. Check analytics is recording data
4. Monitor error logs for 24 hours

1. Log into Vercel dashboard
2. Navigate to the project
3. Select "Deployments" tab
4. Find the last stable deployment
5. Click "..." menu and select "Promote to Production"
6. Verify rollback is successful
