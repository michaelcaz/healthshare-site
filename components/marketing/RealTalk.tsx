    description: "Traditional insurance offers a legal contract. In theory, this means protection if they deny your claim.\n\nReality tells a different story. Insurance companies excel at what industry insiders call the \"Delay, Deny, Defend\" strategy. With denial rates reaching 35%-51% for some insurers, that legal protection often means years of fighting against massive corporate legal teams.\n\nThere are thousands of examples of people that have gotten cancer diagnoses, needed heart surgery, been in major accidents, etc. that have been entirely covered by their health share plan (after hitting their IUA).",
    highlight: "Would you rather have the 98%+ needs approval rating of health share companies on this marketplace or the right to sue for a denial and spend 2-3 years trying to fight the best attorneys in the WORLD in court?",

My wife had to have knee surgery soon after we enrolled and everyone was really helpful, the process was straightforward and the community kicked in the funds for the needs of surgery. Sedera is a great solution to the frustrations many people have faced trying to insure a family through traditional health insurance.",

'You're letting strangers sleep in your house?!' Now millions trust it every day. Healthcare's changingâ€”health shares are the next big thing. Early adopters always face skepticism, but with 98%+ needs approval ratings for plans on this marketplace, you're joining a trusted crew, not a gamble.\n\nHealth sharing communities have been operating successfully since the 1980s, with over 2 million Americans currently participating. These are established organizations with long track records of paying eligible medical needs and supporting their members through health crises.",

For larger bills (such as an emergency room visit, accident or other large medical need), you'll submit the need on your health share plan's online portal, and if it's eligible they'll either reimburse you or pay the provider directly.\n\nIt's an extra step. But here's the thing: This step is one of the reasons why you save 30-50% on costs. You're also less likely to have a need above your IUA if you're healthy. Plus, being a cash-pay patient often gets you better service and attention.",
